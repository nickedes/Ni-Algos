In ancient and classical India, the area that is now Bihar was considered a centre of power, learning, and culture.[21] From Magadha arose India's first empire, the Maurya empire, as well as one of the world's most widely adhered-to religions, Buddhism.[22] Magadha empires, notably under the Maurya and Gupta dynasties, unified large parts of South Asia under a central rule.[23] Another region of Bihar is Mithila which was an early centre of Brahmanical learning and the centre of the Videha kingdom.[24] There is an ongoing movement in the Maithili speaking region of Bihar for a separate Indian state of Mithila. What would be the capital of the state has yet to be decided, flag{buT_DArbhang@_&^$_#*@_the_mostlIkly} candidate. Other potential capitals include Muzaffarpur, Purnia, Madhubani and Begusarai
